    <h1 align="center">This is a list of compiled CSS Questions and Answers.</h1>

    <h3>What is the difference between classes and IDs in CSS?</h3>
    <p1>- Classes are used to style a group of elements that are given a specific class tag in HTML.<br>
    - IDs are used for styling a specific element.</p1>

    <h3>What is the difference between block, inline, and inline-block?</h3>
    <p1> Block Elements:
      <ul>
        <li>respect left, right, top and bottom margins and padding</li>
        <li>force a line break after each block element</li>
        <li id="picture"><img src="blockelements.png"></li>
      </ul>
      <br>Inline Elements:
      <ul>
        <li>respect left and right margins and padding but <strong> not </strong> top and bottom</li>
        <li><strong>cannot</strong> have a width and height set</li>
        <li>allow other elements to sit to their left and right </li>
        <li id="picture"><img src="inline.png"></li>
      </ul>
      <br>Inline-block Elements:
      <ul>
        <li>allow other elements to sit to their left and right</li>
        <li>respect top and bottom margins and padding</li>
        <li>respect height and width</li>
        <li id="picture"><img src="inlineblock.png"></li>
      </ul>
    </p1>

    <h3>What's the difference between a relative, fixed, absolute and statically positioned element?</h3>
    <p1>Static (default)
      <ul>
        <li>not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties</li>
        <li>always positioned according to the normal flow of the page</li>
      </ul>
      <br>Relative
      <ul>
        <li>This type of positioning needs to be complemented with some sort of positioning attribute.
        Otherwise, it will stay as if the element is statically positioned.</li>
        <li>If you do have some other positioning attribute such as top: 10px, it will move the
          elements position <strong>DOWN</strong> 10px.</li>
        <li>Elemenets that are positioned relatively have the ability to use the z-index on that element.</li>
      </ul>
      <br> Fixed
      <ul>
        <li>A fixed element stays where it is relative to the viewpoint (browser window itself)</li>
        <li>For example, a fixed element will stay where it is even when the page is scrolled </li>
      </ul>
      <br>Absolute
      <ul>
        <li>This type of positioning allows you put the element where ever you wish by using the positioning
          attributes <strong>top, left, bottom, and right</strong></li>
        <li>This element is bound to its next parent so these positioning attribute values will be positioned
          relative to its next parent with relative or absolute positioning. If no such parent exists, this
          element will be positioned relative to the entire page itself.</li>
        <li>Elements that are positioned absolutely are removed from the flow of the page and are not affected
          by other elements. These elements also do not affect any other elements on the page.</li>
        </ul>
    </p1>
    <h3>What is the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" in CSS? Which would you choose and why?</h3>
    <p1>- Reset will remove all default styling applied by the browser giving you a blank canvas.<br>
    - Normalize will give you a base stylesheet and styles default elements to be consistent across
    various different browsers.<br> - Personally, I would use normalize.css more because it has become more of an industry standard
    at this point. Normalize.css is also made with HTML5 in mind which makes it all that easier to
    keep up with modern standards in web development.</p1>

    <h3>What is a float and when would you use it?</h3>
    <p1>- "Float" is a CSS positioning property that helps images properly wrap around text. Floats can be
    set to right or left which positions the element to wrap around the text in that respective position.</p>

    <h3>Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.</h3>
    <p1>- The z-index determines the order in which different elements are vertically stacked.<br>
    - It only affects elements that have a position value other than static (the default).<br>
    - Without the z-index, the elements vertically stack as they appear in the DOM.</p1>

    <h3>Describe Block Formattting Context (BFC) and how it works.</h3>
    <p1>- A BFC is defined as an HTML box where
      <ul>
        <li>float : none </li>
        <li>position : fixed | absolute</li>
        <li>display : table-cell | table-caption | inline-block | inline-flex</li>
        <li> overflow : hidden </li>
      </ul>
    </p1>


    <h3>What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?</h3>
    <p1>- Clearing floats forces the containing element to expand to contain its child elements.
    It essentially forces its child elements to appear below it.<br>
    - There are four ways to clear floats.
    <ul>
      <li>.clear {clear: both;}</li>
      <li>.container{overflow:hidden;}</li>
      <li>.clearfix uses the pseudo-elements ::before and ::after. The ::after element is used to clear
        the floats.</li>
      <li>(the newest way).container{min-height: contain-floats;}</li>
    </ul>
    </p1>

    <h3>Explain CSS sprites and how you would implement them.</h3>
    <p1>- CSS Sprites are basically taking multiple images, making them into one image, and displaying
    only part of that large image at a time.<br>
    - Although the total image size goes up, several images are able to load with a single HTTP request.<br>
    - The traditional way of using CSS sprites is setting the same background-image on several CSS classes
    and using the background-position and dimensions of the individual classes to display a single portion
    of the sprite.<br>
    - Another way to use CSS Sprites is to use several frameworks such as Node.js, Compass, Grunt, Gulp, etc.

    <h3>Image Replacement Techniques</h3>
    <p1> CSS Image Replacement is a technique of replacing a text element (usually a header tag)
      with an image. The most common usage of this technique is to display a logo on a page.<br>
      Phark Method
      <ul>
        <li>- This method is used by replacing the block with a background image
          and kicking the text off the page with an indedent.</li>
          <li>- This is the most widely used technique today and keeps screen
            readers happy</li>
        </ul>
      <br>FIR (Fahrner Image Replacement)
      <ul>
        <li>- FIR is a technique that uses a span to wrap the text inside the header
          and use the span to hide the text.</li>
        <li>- Since we use display: none property, this hides the text from screen
          readers and search bots</li>
        </ul>
    </p1>
