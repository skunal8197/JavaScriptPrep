    <h1 align="center">This is a list of compiled CSS Questions and Answers.</h1>

    <h3>What is the difference between classes and IDs in CSS?</h3>
    <p1>- Classes are used to style a group of elements that are given a specific class tag in HTML.<br>
    - IDs are used for styling a specific element.</p1>

    <h3>What is the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" in CSS? Which would you choose and why?</h3>
    <p1>- Reset will remove all default styling applied by the browser giving you a blank canvas.<br>
    - Normalize will give you a base stylesheet and styles default elements to be consistent across
    various different browsers.<br> - Personally, I would use normalize.css more because it has become more of an industry standard
    at this point. Normalize.css is also made with HTML5 in mind which makes it all that easier to
    keep up with modern standards in web development.</p1>

    <h3>What is a float and when would you use it?</h3>
    <p1>- "Float" is a CSS positioning property that helps images properly wrap around text. Floats can be
    set to right or left which positions the element to wrap around the text in that respective position.</p>

    <h3>Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.</h3>
    <p1>- The z-index determines the order in which different elements are vertically stacked.<br>
    - It only affects elements that have a position value other than static (the default).<br>
    - Without the z-index, the elements vertically stack as they appear in the DOM.</p1>

    <h3>Describe Block Formattting Context (BFC) and how it works.</h3>
    <p1>- A BFC is defined as an HTML box where
      <ul>
        <li>float : none </li>
        <li>position : fixed | absolute</li>
        <li>display : table-cell | table-caption | inline-block | inline-flex</li>
        <li> overflow : hidden </li>
      </ul>
    </p1>


    <h3>What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?</h3>
    <p1>- Clearing floats forces the containing element to expand to contain its child elements.
    It essentially forces its child elements to appear below it.<br>
    - There are four ways to clear floats.
    <ul>
      <li>.clear {clear: both;}</li>
      <li>.container{overflow:hidden;}</li>
      <li>.clearfix uses the pseudo-elements ::before and ::after. The ::after element is used to clear
        the floats.</li>
      <li>(the newest way).container{min-height: contain-floats;}</li>
    </ul>
    </p1>

    <h3>Explain CSS sprites and how you would implement them.</h3>
    <p1>- CSS Sprites are basically taking multiple images, making them into one image, and displaying
    only part of that large image at a time.<br>
    - Although the total image size goes up, several images are able to load with a single HTTP request.<br>
    - The traditional way of using CSS sprites is setting the same background-image on several CSS classes
    and using the background-position and dimensions of the individual classes to display a single portion
    of the sprite.<br>
    - Another way to use CSS Sprites is to use several frameworks such as Node.js, Compass, Grunt, Gulp, etc.
